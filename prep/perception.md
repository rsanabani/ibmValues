**Summary of the Values Framework Pillars**
The Values Framework provides a structured approach to understanding how different dimensions of value influence stakeholder perceptions and perceptions. Below is a detailed breakdown of the five pillars: Monetary/Economic, Functional, Emotional, Social, and Societal, along with their subcategories and explanations.
1. Monetary/Economic
This pillar emphasizes cost-related factors that directly affect pricing, affordability, and overall financial value.
Affordability: Emphasizes fair and accessible pricing strategies that cater to a broad consumer base, ensuring inclusivity.
Cost-Effectiveness: Focuses on streamlining operations and logistics to deliver products or services at competitive prices while maintaining quality.
Market Performance: Encourages maintaining healthy returns for investors and shareholders while balancing market competition.
Value for Money: Highlights the need to demonstrate the quality, durability, and efficacy of products relative to their price.
Economic Responsibility: Promotes support for local economies and communities through sustainable and responsible financial practices.
2. Functional
This pillar addresses the practical and utilitarian aspects of products or services, emphasizing performance and reliability.
Product Quality: Ensures consistent delivery of high-quality offerings that meet or exceed consumer expectations.
Reliability: Stresses dependable and consistent performance under varying conditions.
Ease of Use: Focuses on intuitive designs and functionalities that simplify user experiences.
Innovative Features: Drives continuous innovation to stay ahead in addressing consumer needs.
3. Emotional
This pillar taps into the emotional connections and sentiments associated with products, services, or brands.
Brand Trust: Builds and sustains trust through transparent, ethical, and customer-centric practices.
Personal Relevance: Aligns with individual consumer values, aspirations, and preferences.
Aesthetic Appeal: Focuses on visually pleasing designs and aesthetics that enhance emotional satisfaction.
4. Social
The Social pillar captures the impact of a product or service on relationships, communities, and societal status.
Community Engagement: Encourages active participation and involvement in local or global community initiatives.
Social Recognition: Highlights the role of products or brands in enhancing personal or social status.
Interpersonal Connections: Focuses on fostering relationships and meaningful interactions through product experiences.
5. Societal

Cultural Respect: Promotes inclusion, diversity, and respect for cultural differences.


**Perception:**
The qualitative evaluation of how stakeholders (e.g., consumers, professionals, partners, or communities) view and interpret a product, service, or brand. Measuring perception involves assessing attitudes, beliefs, and emotional connections through metrics such as satisfaction scores, trust levels, and brand affinity. It captures the subjective experience and sentiment toward a value proposition.

Perception influences demand by shaping how stakeholders evaluate the benefits and relevance of a product or service.

**Perception Matrix:**
[{'value': 'Economic', 'entity': 'Open AI', 'perception': nan},
 {'value': 'Functional', 'entity': 'Open AI', 'perception': nan},
 {'value': 'Emotional', 'entity': 'Open AI', 'perception': nan},
 {'value': 'Social', 'entity': 'Open AI', 'perception': nan},
 {'value': 'Societal', 'entity': 'Open AI', 'perception': nan},
 {'value': 'Economic', 'entity': 'Google', 'perception': nan},
 {'value': 'Functional', 'entity': 'Google', 'perception': nan},
 {'value': 'Emotional', 'entity': 'Google', 'perception': nan},
 {'value': 'Social', 'entity': 'Google', 'perception': nan},
 {'value': 'Societal', 'entity': 'Google', 'perception': nan},

 {'value': 'Societal', 'entity': 'IBM', 'perception': nan}]

 **Evaluation Instructions**
Assign a perception score between 0 and 100 to each value-entity pair in the perception matrix. A score of 0 indicates minimal perception, suggesting low interest, relevance, or utility, while a score of 100 represents extremely high perception, reflecting strong interest, high relevance, and significant utility. Assess the perception based on the following considerations:

1. Relevance to Stakeholder Needs: Evaluate how well the value offering aligns with the priorities, preferences, and expectations of stakeholders.
2. Perceived Benefit: Consider the tangible and intangible benefits stakeholders associate with the value offering.
Market Trends: Factor in broader market dynamics, such as emerging preferences, competitive offerings, and external conditions that influence perception.
3. Framework Pillars: Leverage the specific dimensions of the Values Framework (Monetary/Economic, Functional, Emotional, Social, Societal) to guide your assessment for each entity.
4. Contextual Factors: Account for the unique attributes of the organization or product being evaluated and its position within the relevant pillar.

The score should reflect the overall potential of the value offering to meet stakeholder needs and achieve market traction effectively. Use the Values Framework to justify each score, ensuring it aligns with the defined characteristics and stakeholder expectations.

**Judgment Over Speed:**
Take your time to carefully evaluate each value-entity pair and apply your professional expertise and understanding of the framework to assign a score that is thoughtful, reasoned, and contextually appropriate.

**Final Output Format Instructions:**
Respond with a valid JSON array strictly matching the structure of the provided perception Matrix. Each item in the array must include the following fields:

value (string): The name of the entity being assessed (e.g., "Open AI," "Google").
entity (string): The category or pillar (e.g., "Economic," "Functional").
perception (integer): A score between 0 and 100 representing the assessed perception. Replace all instances of nan with a calculated numeric perception score, as per the scoring criteria provided in the Evaluation Instructions section.
Your response must begin with [ and end with ]. Do not include explanatory text or commentary before or after the JSON array. Ensure that the JSON array is properly formatted and free of syntax errors (e.g., no trailing commas, missing brackets, or unquoted strings).

Example Output:
[
  {"value": "Economic", "entity": "Open AI", "perception": 85},
  {"value": "Economic", "entity": "Google", "perception": 72},
  {"value": "Economic", "entity": "Microsoft", "perception": 90},
  {"value": "Economic", "entity": "Meta", "perception": 60},
  {"value": "Economic", "entity": "IBM", "perception": 78}
]
Ensure your output mirrors the structure of the provided perception Matrix and replaces every nan with an appropriate score
