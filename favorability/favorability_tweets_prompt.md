**Context and Objective:**  
We are analyzing a batch of tweets that discuss various aspects of open-source AI ecosystems, decentralized technologies, incentivized testnets, corporate involvement in open-source, community engagement, emerging AI tools, and related themes.

**Input Data Description:**  
You have been provided with a set of tweets as input. Do your best to separate and understand tweets logically. Extract and analyze data carefully and accurately.

Clearly identify each mention of Google, OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and IBM.
Any other company name goes under "Other".

Analyze the following concatenated tweets for mentions of the following companies: Google, OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and IBM. Additionally, identify and count mentions of any other companies under the category "Other." Perform sentiment analysis to determine the favorability of each mention and calculate an overall score for each company based on the following scale:

1-3: Very unfavorable
4-6: Neutral or mixed sentiment
7-10: Very favorable
For each company (including "Other"), provide:

The number of times it is mentioned.
The average favorability score (rounded to two decimal places).

**Accuracy Over Speed:**  
   Take your time to accurately count and score each tweet. Do not estimate or guess if the data is not present. Be as precise as possible, especially with counts.

**Final Output Format:**  
   The final answer must be a valid JSON object following the exact structure below. Do not include explanatory text before or after the JSON—just output the JSON. Strictly respond in this JSON format beginning with "{" and ending with "}": 

{
  "Google": {
    "mentions": [Number of mentions],
    "average_score": [Average favorability score]
  },
  "OpenAI": {
    "mentions": [Number of mentions],
    "average_score": [Average favorability score]
  },
  "Meta": {
    "mentions": [Number of mentions],
    "average_score": [Average favorability score]
  },
  "Microsoft": {
    "mentions": [Number of mentions],
    "average_score": [Average favorability score]
  },
  "IBM": {
    "mentions": [Number of mentions],
    "average_score": [Average favorability score]
  },
  "Other": {
    "mentions": [Number of mentions],
    "average_score": [Average favorability score]
  }
}


-----------------------

You are an expert in analyzing tweets related to open-source AI and decentralized technologies,

We have a batch of tweets (provided as a single concatenated text) that discuss open-source AI, decentralized technologies, incentivized testnets, corporate involvement, community engagement, and emerging AI tools. Your goal is to:

Separate the concatenated tweets into individual tweets where possible.
Identify mentions of the following companies: Google, OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and IBM. All other company mentions fall under "Other".
Perform sentiment analysis on each company mention, assigning a favorability score (1 to 10) for each mention:
1–3: Very unfavorable
4–6: Neutral or mixed sentiment
7–10: Very favorable
For each company, calculate the total number of mentions and the average favorability score (rounded to two decimal places).
Emphasize accuracy over speed—only provide data that can be confirmed from the tweets.



Explanation & Required Output Format
Separate and Understand Tweets

Divide the concatenated text into distinct tweets where you are certain the separation is correct.
Avoid guessing if you are unsure.
Company Mentions

Clearly identify each mention of Google, OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and IBM.
Any other company name goes under "Other".
Sentiment Scoring

Assign a score (1–10) to each mention of a company based on its favorability in context.
Do not speculate if the sentiment is not clear from the text.
Calculations

mentions: Total count of how many times a company appears in the tweets.
average_score: Mean favorability (1–10) of all mentions for that company, rounded to two decimal places.
Final Output

Respond only with a valid JSON object (no extra text, headers, or explanations).
Use the exact structure below (including the same property names, in the same order, and camel case is not used):

{
  "Google": {
    "mentions": [Number of mentions],
    "average_score": [Average favorability score]
  },
  "OpenAI": {
    "mentions": [Number of mentions],
    "average_score": [Average favorability score]
  },
  "Meta": {
    "mentions": [Number of mentions],
    "average_score": [Average favorability score]
  },
  "Microsoft": {
    "mentions": [Number of mentions],
    "average_score": [Average favorability score]
  },
  "IBM": {
    "mentions": [Number of mentions],
    "average_score": [Average favorability score]
  },
  "Other": {
    "mentions": [Number of mentions],
    "average_score": [Average favorability score]
  }
}

Make sure there is nothing else before or after this JSON object.
