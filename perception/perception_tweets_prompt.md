rational and solid examples
(helps it imporive its analysis) - takes more time 
be explicit about confidence thta the data, lean more towards lower number
confidence score if unknown give it N/A if trace were not present in tweet set
if value/tweet association, is too vague discard example 

is that sentiment directly exoressed towards the company or is it implied 

**Context and Objective:**  
We are is analyzing a batch of tweets that discuss various aspects of open-source AI ecosystems, decentralized technologies, incentivized testnets, corporate involvement in open-source, community engagement, emerging AI tools, and related themes. Your goal is to help us understand how to better engage with and amplify their open-source presence. This involves identifying key trends, community sentiments, and factors influencing adoption and collaboration.
 
**Input Data Description:**  
You have been provided with a set of tweets as input. Do your best to separate and understand tweets logically and understand the collection of tweets in their entirety. Extract and analyze data carefully and accurately.
 
**Instructions:**  
1. **Read through all provided tweets carefully before producing results.**  

# Definitions:

**Stakeholder** 
The open source developer community this could include any entiry whether an organization or individula or initiative

**Perception:**
The qualitative evaluation of how stakeholders (e.g., consumers, professionals, partners, or communities) view and interpret a product, service, or brand. Measuring perception involves assessing attitudes, beliefs, and emotional connections through metrics such as satisfaction scores, trust levels, and brand affinity. It captures the subjective experience and sentiment toward a value proposition.

Perception influences deemand by shaping how stakeholders evaluate the benefits and relevance of a product or service.

**Evaluation Instructions**
Bsed on the understanding of the tweets and the context of open source at large assign perception score between 0 and 100 to each value-entity pair in the perception matrix. A score of 0 indicates minimal perception, suggesting low interest, relevance, or utility, while a score of 100 represents extremely high perception, reflecting strong interest, high relevance, and significant utility. Assess the perception based on the following considerations:

1. Relevance to Stakeholder Needs: Evaluate how well the value offering aligns with the priorities, preferences, and expectations of the open source community.
2. Perceived Benefit: Consider the tangible and intangible benefits stakeholders associate with the value offering.
Market Trends: Factor in broader market dynamics, such as emerging preferences, competitive offerings, and external conditions that influence perception.
3. Framework Pillars: Leverage the specific dimensions of the Values Framework (Monetary/Economic, Functional, Emotional, Social, Societal) to guide your assessment for each entity.
4. Contextual Factors: Account for the unique attributes of the organization or product being evaluated and its position within the relevant pillar.

The score should reflect the overall potential of the value offering to meet stakeholder needs and achieve market traction effectively. Use the Values Framework to justify each score, ensuring it aligns with the defined characteristics and stakeholder expectations.

 {'value': 'Economic', 'entity': 'IBM', 'perception': nan}]

 **Accuracy Over Speed:**
Take your time to accurately assess and score each value-entity pair. Be as precise as possible, especially when assigning scores.

**Final Output Format Instructions:**
Respond with a valid JSON array strictly matching the structure of the provided perception Matrix. Each item in the array must include the following fields:

value (string): The name of the entity being assessed (e.g., "Open AI," "Google").
entity (string): The category or pillar (e.g., "Economic," "Functional").
perception (integer): A score between 0 and 100 representing the assessed perception. Replace all instances of nan with a calculated numeric perception score, as per the scoring criteria provided in the Evaluation Instructions section.
Your response must begin with [ and end with ]. Do not include explanatory text or commentary before or after the JSON array. Ensure that the JSON array is properly formatted and free of syntax errors (e.g., no trailing commas, missing brackets, or unquoted strings).

Example Output:
[
  {"value": "Economic", "entity": "Open AI", "perception": 85},
  {"value": "Economic", "entity": "Google", "perception": 72},
